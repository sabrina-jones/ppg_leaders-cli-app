# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application. I met this requirement by accepting user input and displaying information for them after their input.
- [X ] Pull data from an external source. Met this requirement by scrapping 3 websites to get initial list information that is displayed to the user.
- [X] Implement both list and detail views. I met this requirement by allowing the user to see more information after they select a certain player to learn more about. The user gets a small summary of that players accomplishments.
